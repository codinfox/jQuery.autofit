{"name":"jQuery.autofit","tagline":"A jQuery plugin used to fit the image to the size of a frame.","body":"jQuery.autofit\r\n==============\r\nTiny but useful jQuery plugin to free you from fitting your images to the frame.\r\n\r\n## What's this?\r\n\r\nWell, when doing personal project, I find that sometimes I need to write some codes to make my image fit the frame, which means sometimes your image is too large for a `div`. I want to make this job less tiring. <br/>\r\n\r\njQuery.autofit enables you to write fewer codes but make your image display properly in a frame(by which I mean a `div` or some other container).\r\n\r\n## How to\r\n\r\nTo make this plugin work, you need to: \r\n\r\n* make the container `position`ed\r\n* make the container `overflow: hidden`\r\n* set the height and width of your container\r\n* make your image(or something else) `abusolute` positioned\r\n\r\nand then, you need just to :\r\n\r\n\t$(document).ready(function(){\r\n\t\t$(\"img\").autofit();\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n### Some Options\r\n#### Default Config\r\n\r\nMaybe you just want to use the default config, then you could:\r\n\r\n\t$(document).ready(function(){\r\n\t\t$(\"img\").autofit({\r\n\t\t\tdefaultConfig : true,\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t});\r\n\r\nand you could get the default config. <br/>\r\nBut *REMEMBER*, what the default config will do is just to modify the CSS of your container and images to\r\n\r\n\t#container {\r\n\t\tposition: relative;\r\n\t\toverflow: hidden;\r\n\t}\r\n\t#img {\r\n\t\tposition: absolute;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThe default value is `false`\r\n\r\n#### Height/Width\r\n\r\nDue to some reasons, you may be unable to set the height and width of your container, then you may define them:\r\n\r\n\t$.autofit({\r\n\t\theight: `number`,\r\n\t\twidth: `number`,\r\n\t});\r\n\r\nThe attributes may be not effective under some circumstances, like the size of the frame is already set.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Cut\r\n\r\nBy setting the cut attribute to `true`, you \"cut\" a part of your image to display in the frame instead of resize the image. Simply follow:\r\n\r\n\t$.autofit({\r\n\t\tcut : true,\r\n\t});\r\n\r\nThe default value is `true`\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Codinfox\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
